The Tournament XPerience

Provides Tournament Prize options as well as enhances the xp in tournaments and arena fights.  It originally provided xp gain in tournaments but that is now a feature in the core game as of 1.0.6.

Technical Design Decisions/Rules
I will not override/replace any stock game default model or behavior.  I will allow myself the option to add new behaviors that will work alongside the existing ones, but they will not be replaced by a customized version.
If I am going to alter vanilla models/behaviors it will be done purely by harmony injection.
The theory with that is that if I use injection it should remain cross-compatible with any other mod.  If you use model replacement, it's a last mod wins.

Any feature should be able to be turned off or on by the end-user.
Any numerical value should be editable by the end-user.

I only provide options and guidelines on how a player can play.  It's left up to them to decide what to enable, and how they want to alter their game.  I hate cooks to think food must be eaten their way and no other.
